Project for creating an automated platform for managing employee details

# Goal of the project

in the sub-book which is maintained for shift. The entire process consumes time and is
problematic when a person is unable to visit the office. This is a difficult task for both the employees and the managers. The goal of the project is to created an automated system for scheduling for employees and managers.
